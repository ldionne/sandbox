# ldionne's sandbox
This repository contains snippets of code, prototypes and more. It is only a
way of organizing my chaos, and you should _NOT_ be using this.

Most things are my own creation, but some things are copy/pasted from blog
posts (and sometimes modified). Unless there's a copyright notice in a file,
you can assume I don't claim any right to what's here.
